Run library and packages
```{R}
install.packages("linprog")
library("linprog")
library(dplyr)
library(DataCombine)
library(reshape)
install.packages("readxl")
library(readxl)
library(data.table)
```

Load the raw data 
```{R}

data<-read.csv("case_study.csv")
summary(data)
```

Remove null values 
```{R}
data1<- data[!(is.na(data$Sku.Size) | data$Sku.Size==""), ]
data2<- data1[!(is.na(data1$Channel.Name) | data1$Channel.Name==""), ]
data3<- data2[!(is.na(data2$Sku.Size) | data2$Sku.Size==""), ]
```

Find uniqu sku to treat on normalization 
```{R}
sku_list<- unique(data3$Sku.Size)

lower_case<- tolower(sku_list)
```

Create the list of sku to replace with identical names

```{R}

# Replace patterns and return full data frame
```{R}

```


View(ABNewDF)

Run the SQL query to format the dataframe and finding the insights per months

```{R}
abnewdf1<- sqldf('select Type,"Channel.Name",State,"Sku.Size",

                        from ABNewDF
                        group by Type,"Channel.Name",State,"Sku.Size" ')

```

View(abnewdf1)

Transform the data using melt and create the approprate schema 

```{R}

md <- melt(abnewdf1, id=(c("Type","Channel.Name","State","Sku.Size")))
colnames(md)
name<- c("Type","Channel.Name","State","Sku.Size","Date","Sum")
setnames(md, name)
colnames(md)
```

View(md)

Filter the data for the MRP value evaluation 
```{R}
total_mrp<- md %>% 
  select(Type,Channel.Name,State,Sku.Size,Date,Sum) %>%
  filter(Type == "Total MRP")

```

Create a formula to find the INR_LT
```{R}
View(total_mrp)
total_mrp$Sum <- total_mrp$Sum*1000
```


Seperate the Sales volumes for the calculation 
```{R}
sales<- md %>% 
  select(Type,Channel.Name,State,Sku.Size,Date,Sum) %>%
  filter(Type == "Sales Volume (KL)")

```

Run the calculation and create the final date frame for each SKU, State and Channel name 

```{R}

INR_LT<- total_mrp$Sum/sales$Sum

Final_data<- cbind(total_mrp,INR_LT)
keep<- c("Channel.Name","State","Sku.Size","Date","INR_LT")
Final_data1<-Final_data[keep]
```
